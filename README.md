# Pacman

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/mwtegelaers/PacMan/_apis/build/status/BeardedPlatypus.PacMan?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/mwtegelaers/PacMan/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

A simple WIP PacMan clone written in C++ with SDL2.

## Motivation

The primary aim of this project is to develop a simple but polished PacMan game
to improve my understanding of C++ and game development in general and to 
showcase my current software engineering skills. At the end of this journey, I
hope to have implemented the different aspects of the pacman game, including the
rendering, sound, ui and ai. Furthermore, to tie it all together, the product 
should come with a working installer.

As a portfolio piece, the code itself is made available under the MIT license, 
and is available to be reused in other projects. If you decide to reuse any part,
some form of attribution is very appreciated, but not required.

## Current state

For an overview of what has been developed, and what I am currently working on,
I would direct you the azure devops boards page, which can be found [here]().

## Installation

### To play

In order to just play the game, the installer can be found [here](). Keep in 
mind that at the time of writing this is a work in progress.

### To develop

In order to compile and develop on your own machine, several tools need to be
installed. A step by step guide for this can be found here [here](). The 
rationale behind the different technologies can be found in the blog articles.

## Documentation

The extracted API can be found on the following github page:

Different aspects of the development process have been documented in more detail
in different articles on my blog:
